# ðŸ’½ Assistant


A small utility sitting in the tray, which offers several handy functions lacking for windows, like hot corners, clipboard management, caffeine...

It runs on Windows Forms, and has a .exe file. You dont need special rights to start it, you dont need to install it, just put it somewhere where it wont move.


### Done and tested
- Keep awake: Toggle between preventing computer to go to sleep or not
- Hot corner overview : Hitting the top left edge triggers an overview
- Hot corner hover meta : Hitting the botton left (windows logo) opens the start menu
- Hot corner show desktop : Hitting bottom right shows desktop
- Autostart : Start Assistant with Windows
- Settings : Edit the settings file to change stuff. Careful of following powershell syntax or it breaks
- Clipboard manager : Remembers past copied elements and toggle between them. Useful if you need to copy paste
- Localization (I can German, French, and Spanish, only. Itd detect if the puter use those languages)
- Saves state : Remembers what was enabled or not

### Todo, maybe, idk
- Switch clipboard by scrolling on icon
- OCR
- Better localizations

# ðŸ’º "Installation"

On the right on this page, go on "releases"

Download the zip folder

Uncompress it

Click on Assistant.exe

A notification should poke you to tell you Assistant has started

The exe does not work on its own, it needs the other folders
The hot corners needs their own separate files. They do not work as background process. You can use them alone, but then need the task manager to stop them (no UI)


# ðŸ“š Documentation

### Clipboard history

Shows the last 6 copied elements.
Click on any item to have it be the last (the one you get when pasting)
You can clear clipboard history by clicking on "Clear history"

This uses Windows native feature (what you get with Meta+V) to retrieve history



### Hot corners
Hot corners are zones on the screen which activates something when touched. This is useful if you want to have something by just throwing your mouse at it

 - #### Top left: Overview
Hit the top left edge of the screen.
An overview of all windows and virtual desktops will appear.
Hit it a second time to go back, or click on any window

 - #### Bottom left: Show start menu

Hover the windows logo in the bottom right.
The start menu will appear


 - #### Bottom right: Show desktop

Hit the mouse in the bottom left of the screen, that is where the "show desktop" mini button is.
It will at first hide all windows to show the desktop
hit it a second time to make all windows reappear

 - #### Top right: Close active window

Hit the mouse in the top right of the screen to close the current focused window (NOT the maximized one)
This is Alt+F4 with extra steps, so you should get a window asking for saving if it is something like Word
By default the hot corner is smaller and less reactive, in case of accidental movements


### Keep awake
When activated, the computer is prevented to go to sleep. The screen stays on.


### Start with puter
Create a shortcut in the autostart folder. If theres already one, theres a check
When Windows starts up, Assistant will start too.


# ðŸ¦º Known bugs
Does not quit super cleanly : There is still a zombie process running, it does nothing nor take resources but locks the file so nobody can delete or move it until the process is killed, or not started at all when the puter starts
