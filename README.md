# Documentation

### Hot corner: Top left
The program constantly checks whether the mouse is in the top left
Simulate Meta + D

### Hot corner: Hover meta

The program constantly checks whether the mouse is in the bottom
Simulates Meta

### Keep awake

The computer is prevented to go to sleep by simulating a keypress on F15.
This key shouldnt be used by any program nor appear on the keyboard but... If there is weird behavior it could come from here.
