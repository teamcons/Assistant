# ðŸ’½ CountingSheeps

### Count files !

and how long it takes to proofread them (1800 words -> 1 hour basis), because i need that at work.

Its not great for PDF and PPT, but everything else it rocks.

Startup is slow due to interacting with Office. Which is slow.

# ðŸ’½ Energy Drink

### Stay awake ! Prevent your computer from going to sleep

Windows doesnt respect or leave untouched some settings
And im annoyed when i read something or wait for emails, and it goes to sleep
So this just creates an icon in systray and keeps the puter awake.

NEW: Also now has an option to activate a window and workspaces overview as top left hot corner

### Features:
- Can toggle between preventing sleep or not
- Can activate a hot corner for overview, if the warmedge exe is present

# ðŸ’½ Warmedge

### Top left hot corner

Im used to having a top left hot corner for overivew, like in Gnome-shell.

I wanted it in EnergyDrink but it does not work if its not a separate process.
So here is a companion executable which needs to be in the same folder.

# Super Skrivanek Suite

Its part of the suite of softwares/scripts we did to assist at work. Which is why CountingSheep estimates proofreading time.

Every file is a standalone, and depends only on itself. All assets are embedded in the code in Base64.

GUI is built to be minimal. Dont display unneeded options and features, be smart.

Only dependency is PS2EXE if you want to have the fancy exe.
